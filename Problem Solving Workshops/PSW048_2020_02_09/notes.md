# Question 1
## use counter to track time
## reset both global adder and global multiplier when you multiply by 0
## on set opration need to take into global multiplier and global adder into account
### simple adder case - set operation -> set(8) = 8 - global adder
### simple multiplier case - set operation -> set(8) = 8 / global multiplier


# Question 2
1. number of leaf nodes.
2. Path span: tree traversal with a bit tracking on change of parent value increment 
3. # max over all children + 1
