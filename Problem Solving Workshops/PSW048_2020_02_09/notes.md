# 1
## use counter to track time
## reset both global adder and global multiplier when you multiply by 0
## on set opration need to take into global multiplier and global adder into account
### simple adder case - set operation -> set(8) = 8 - global adder
### simple multiplier case - set operation -> set(8) = 8 / global multiplier
